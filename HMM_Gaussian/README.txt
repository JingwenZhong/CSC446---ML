1. Init_model:

	For each mu: Generate a random number from normal distribution with mean=0, sigma = 1.5 (last time was 0, 1)
	For sigmas: each sigma looks like: array([[1., 0.],[0., 1.]]), 
		    If it's tied covariance then it will look like: array([[1., 0.],[0., 1.]])
	For transitions: Each transition is generated by random number, and devide each transition in each cluster by the sum of all 
transitions for each cluster i, so transitions for each cluster can add up to 1
	For initials: each initial equals to 1 / cluster_num so in total it can add up to 1


2. Hyperparameter and best number of state:

	Since the best combination of hyperparameters for em gaussian I chose was cluster_num = 5, iteration = 50. I started from 
this combination. cluster_num = 5, iteration = 50. (Zhong_hmm_gaussian_ll_1.jpg, and final LL results for train = -3.72, dev= -3.70)

	I tried cluster_num = 3, iteration = 50(Zhong_hmm_gaussian_ll_2.jpg), and cluster_num = 10, iteration = 50(Zhong_hmm_gaussian_ll_3.jpg)
		
	The result of cluseter number 5 is clearly better than the cluster number 3(also final LL for train=-4.24, dev=-4.3 ), and the plot 
for cluster number 10 shows that it has an overfitting problem after iteration 10.

	From the Zhong_hmm_gaussian_ll_1.jpg, we can see that the curve is flattened after round iteration 10 , so I ran cluster_num = 5, 
iteration = 10 (Zhong_hmm_gaussian_ll_4).

	The final LL result for iteration 10 actually does not change much (train=-3.73, dev= -3.70).
		
	Therefore the the best number of state I will choose is still cluster_num = 5. and the best combination of hyperparameter will be
cluster_num = 5, iteration = 10


3.Does the HMM model the data better than the original non-sequence model

	Yes, it is very clear that HMM model is better than origninal non sequence Gaussian Mixture Model, the best final results for GMM I ran 
last time was train=-4.35, and dev=-4.325.

	Also, HMM takes less iteration to get the best result, it is faster.
